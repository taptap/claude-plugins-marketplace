# Changelog

## 0.1.38

### Test Plugin (0.0.7)

- Added `mcp__cases__save_test_cases` in-process MCP tool path for all `*_cases.json` writes: schema is built from backend `case_schema.TestCase` (Pydantic v2) via `TypeAdapter`, enforced at the Anthropic API generation layer so field-name typos and structural drift are rejected before the tool call lands; `Write *_cases.json` now denied by hook and redirected to the new tool
- Changed change-analysis, test-case-generation, test-case-review PHASES.md to instruct the model to call `mcp__cases__save_test_cases` instead of `Write`; Bash-merge escape retained for >50-case files (`test_cases.json`, `final_cases.json`) where pure LLM output paths risk token truncation
- Changed test-case-writer agent: removed `Write` from `tools`, added `mcp__cases__save_test_cases`; removed self-check section since schema is now enforced at generation
- Changed CONVENTIONS.md "严格校验" section to reflect the new layered defense (input_schema → tool-side `validate_cases` → hook redirect) instead of the obsolete PreToolUse hook narrative
- Changed test-case-generation PHASES.md to drop "post_complete 自动修正/兜底" framing in favor of "schema enforced at generation"
- Changed `_shared/LARGE_FILE_HANDLING.md` to clarify that MCP tool input is subject to the same LLM token limit as Write
- Fixed requirement-review degraded mode: allow review to proceed when requirement doc is missing instead of hard-blocking

### Marketplace

- Bumped version from 0.1.37 to 0.1.38
- Updated test plugin to version 0.0.7

## 0.1.35 — Test plugin major refactor: traceability auto-writeback, handoff pilot, cross-repo contract bridge

### Test Plugin (0.0.5)

- Added requirement-clarification handoff pilot: frontmatter declares `handoffs[]` (recommended next skill, when, prompt hint); Closing step now emits a structured "Next Steps" block with copyable Skill() invocation and explicit confirm-to-relay prompt (spec-kit-style pattern, validated on a single skill before broader rollout)
- Added Phase 6 writeback in requirement-traceability: standard mode now invokes metersphere-sync execute internally to write back MS test plan case status, so running traceability standalone (outside qa-workflow) no longer leaves MS plans empty; smoke-test mode still skips MS write
- Changed qa-workflow to drop the standalone metersphere-sync execute step (#9 removed) since write-back is now handled by traceability; qa-full step IDs renumbered (#10/#11/#12 → #9/#10/#11); qa-lite/verify-only template skip lists updated; PHASES.md cross-references and earlier numbering inconsistencies fixed
- Removed `verification-test-generation` skill (and `agents/verification-test-writer.md`); merged its core capability into requirement-traceability's forward channel as embedded 3.2.0 traceability assessment + 3.2.1 tracing flow steps; retired the `verification_cases.json` intermediate artifact
- Changed requirement-traceability forward channel: now consumes `final_cases.json` directly (priority 1) → `requirement_points.json` acceptance_criteria (priority 2) → traceability_checklist.md descriptions (weakest); writes upstream `case_id` directly into `forward_verification.json` so MS write-back can match at test-case granularity (FP-level aggregation only in degraded mode)
- Changed `_shared/TRACEABILITY_PROTOCOL.md` artifact spec from "verification cases JSON format" to "forward_verification.json format" with updated field schema; CONVENTIONS.md numbering prefix table removed `VC-`
- Added cross-repo contract bridge with ai-case backend: `scripts/contract-bridge-check.py` validates skill contract.yaml output declarations against backend consumer references; rr_summary.json / ca_summary.json now declared in producer contracts
- Added 4 JSON schemas under `contracts/`: testcase.schema.json (auto-derived from ai-case Pydantic), defect-list.schema.json (catches field name drift), smoke-test-report.schema.json (catches verdict/summary drift), rr-summary.schema.json, ca-summary.schema.json
- Added codex_agent.py (`shared-tools/scripts/`): standalone OpenAI Chat Completions + Tool Use agent loop for Codex cross-validation when codex CLI unavailable; supports bash/read_file/grep tools with sandboxed work_dir
- Added codex-change-analyzer agent in change-analysis Phase 3.5 for parallel cross-validation analysis with environment-aware fallback (codex CLI → codex_agent.py → claude-fallback)
- Added contract-driven RR/CA summary outputs in test-case-generation: skill produces rr_summary.json / ca_summary.json with structured fields consumed by ai-case workflows
- Added strict case JSON schema enforcement across MS import path: rejects AI-written `tags` field (assigned by backend per workflow type)
- Added exploratory testing method as the 7th test method in test-case-generation, CONVENTIONS.md, and test-case-writer agent
- Added `_shared/TEST_QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md` to deduplicate rules across unit-test-design and integration-test-design

- Fixed codex_agent.py OpenAI call timeout: floored to 5s to avoid passing 0/negative values to SDK when `elapsed` approaches budget
